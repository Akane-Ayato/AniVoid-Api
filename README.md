# AniVoid API

Our own API layer on top of the **official AniKoto public API** (`anikotoapi.site`).
The official API stays the single source of truth ("engine"); this project adds the endpoints it lacks.

| Endpoint | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/search?keyword=&page=` | anikototv.to scrape | returns `id`, `poster`, `title` |
| `GET /api/schedule?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | anikototv.to scrape | `slug`, `id`, `title`, `japaneseTitle`, `poster`, `time`, `episode_no` (id/poster matched by title, `null`/`""` if unknown) |
| `GET /api/random` | anikototv.to scrape | returns `id`, `title`, `poster`, `type` |
| `GET /api/top-ten` | anikototv.to scrape | `today` / `week` / `month` → `id`, `title`, `rank`, `poster` |
| `GET /api/completed?page=&per_page=` | `data/completed.json` | built from official API, `status = "Finished Airing"` |
| `GET /api/upcoming?page=&per_page=` | `data/upcoming.json` | built from official API, `status = "Not yet aired"` |
| `GET /api/status` | – | last crawl, next scheduled crawl, file sizes |
| `POST /api/admin/refresh` | – | header `X-Admin-Token`, starts a crawl now |
| `GET/HEAD /heartbeat` (alias `/health`), `GET /docs` | – | keep-alive route for UptimeRobot, Swagger UI |

All responses are `{ "success": true, "results": ... }` (errors: `{ "success": false, "message": ... }`).
No creator/credit fields are added anywhere.

## How it works

```
anikotoapi.site/recent-anime ──(weekly crawl, ≤55 req/120s)──► completed.json
                                                              upcoming.json
                                                              catalog.json  (slug → official id)
anikototv.to (search/schedule/random/top-ten HTML) ──► extractors ──► id resolved via catalog.json
```

**Weekly crawl** (`app/crawler.py`): walks `/recent-anime?per_page=100` page by page through one shared sliding-window
rate limiter (default 55 requests / 120 s, safely under the official 60), splits rows by `status`, then builds the
*new* files fully in memory and swaps them in atomically. The API keeps serving the old files meanwhile, and keeps them
if a crawl fails or comes back incomplete (< 90 % of the reported total). Rows are de-duplicated by `id`
(pages can shift while the crawl runs). A full run is ~90 requests → roughly 2–3 minutes.

* On boot: if `completed.json` **and** `upcoming.json` already exist in `DATA_DIR` (e.g. generated locally and uploaded), **no crawl runs**; 
  they are served as they are and the next rebuild happens at the scheduled time. Only if one of them is missing does a first crawl start.
  If `catalog.json` wasn't uploaded it is rebuilt from the two files (new/airing shows are learned on demand). Upload `catalog.json` too for the best id/poster matching.
  (Optional: `STALE_AFTER_DAYS=N` also re-crawls on boot when the last good crawl is older than N days; off by default.)
* Then: every **Sunday 00:00** in `REFRESH_TZ` (set it to your timezone, e.g. `Asia/Kolkata`); the new files land a few
  minutes later. A short app downtime at 00:00 is tolerated (1 h misfire grace).
* Manual: `python -m app.crawler` or `POST /api/admin/refresh`.

**Ids.** The site's pages carry slugs like `one-piece-odmau`, and the official API returns the same slug together with
the numeric `id`. `catalog.json` maps slug → official id, so every endpoint returns the **official** `id`
(search: `animeId` renamed to `id`; top-ten: `id` added, `name` renamed to `title`). If a slug is unknown (brand-new anime)
the newest 300 rows are pulled from the official API (max once per 10 min); search/random fall back to the id scraped
from the page. `catalog.json` also powers a fallback: if the site is blocked (Cloudflare), `/api/search` and `/api/random`
answer from the catalog and set the header `X-Data-Source: local-catalog`.

## Accounts, profiles & community (v2)

Needs **MongoDB** (free Atlas M0 is fine; uploaded pictures are stored there too, ~40 MB cap per user by default). Without `MONGODB_URI` the anime endpoints keep working and the account endpoints answer `503`.

1. Atlas → free cluster → Database Access user → Network Access (`0.0.0.0/0` for Render) → connection string in `MONGODB_URI`.
2. `SESSION_SECRET` (`python -c "import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`). Changing it signs everybody out.
3. Frontend on Vercel: the browser only talks to the Vercel domain (`api/proxy.js` forwards to this backend), so cookies stay first-party. Use the same random `PROXY_SECRET` here and on Vercel.
4. Google sign-in (optional): OAuth *Web* client id in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, your site origin in *Authorized JavaScript origins*. **Only the client id is needed. Never commit the client secret / `client_secret_*.json` file.**
5. `ADMIN_TOKEN` enables the moderation endpoints and `/api/admin/refresh`. `DISABLE_DOCS=true` hides `/docs` in production.

Features: display names (shown on comments and profiles, separate from the @handle), unlimited-style picture galleries (30 avatars / 12 banners, pick the main one, WebP re-encoded), banners with 8 free presets, **Void Shop** with 106 illustrated avatar decorations (wreaths, flower crowns, flames, crystals, orbiting objects, halos, ears and horns, crowns, wings, magic seals, auras, accessories, floating particles, HUD frames), 31 animated banner scenes, 28 name effects, 16 card styles, 34 titles and 5 sticker packs (40 original animated stickers), 8 animated reactions, VP economy (daily check-in streaks, 6 ranks, 15 computed badges), watch lists, continue-watching sync, public profiles, reports and admin moderation.

| VP source | Points | Daily cap |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome bonus | 50 | once |
| Daily check-in | 10 + 2 per streak day (max 7) | once |
| Episode watched | 5 | 100 |
| Comment | 3 | 15 |
| First time adding an anime to the list | 2 | 10 |

Prices: common 120 · uncommon 320 · rare 700 (rank 1+) · epic 1500 (rank 2+) · legendary 3200 VP (rank 3+); sticker packs 600-1000. All tunable in `app/effects.py` / `app/progress.py`. After editing effects run `python tools/gen_effects.py ../AniVoidTV/assets/effects.css ../AniVoidTV/assets/fx-recipes.js` to regenerate the frontend CSS.

**Security.** scrypt password hashes; DB-backed sessions (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, `__Host-` cookie name when secure) that you can list and revoke, "sign out everywhere", password change signs out other devices; 15-minute lockout after 8 wrong passwords; server-issued single-use captchas; per-IP/user rate limits on login, register, upload, comments, reactions, shop, reports; CSRF header on every write; request-size limits; uploads are fully decoded and re-encoded with Pillow (metadata stripped, decompression-bomb guard, content served with `nosniff` + sandbox CSP); links rejected in bios/names/comments; constant-time token checks; security headers on every response; the proxy exposes only an allow-list of API areas (never `/api/admin`). The rate limiter and captcha cache are in-process: keep one worker.
Password-only accounts have no email recovery; users can connect Google or keep their password safe.

Endpoint reference: `api_endpoints.md` (section 6).

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                                   # edit REFRESH_TZ, ADMIN_TOKEN, ...
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Open http://localhost:8000/docs. Run the tests (offline): `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`.

> Use **one worker** (`--workers 1`): the scheduler and rate limiter live inside the process.

## Docker / VPS

```bash
cp .env.example .env && docker compose up -d --build   # data persists in the api-data volume
```

Without Docker (Ubuntu): copy the project to `/opt/anivoid-api`, create a venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, fill `.env`,
then `sudo cp deploy/anivoid-api.service /etc/systemd/system/ && sudo systemctl enable --now anivoid-api`.
Put nginx in front with `deploy/nginx.conf` (+ `certbot --nginx` for HTTPS).

## Render + UptimeRobot

1. Generate the data locally once (`uvicorn app.main:app`, wait for the crawl, or `python -m app.crawler`) so `data/completed.json`,
   `data/upcoming.json` and `data/catalog.json` exist. They are **not** git-ignored: commit them with the repo (or upload them to a disk).
2. Push to GitHub → Render → New → *Blueprint* (uses `render.yaml`, free plan) or a normal Web Service with
   build `pip install -r requirements.txt`, start `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1 --proxy-headers`.
   Set `REFRESH_TZ` (e.g. `Asia/Kolkata`) and `ADMIN_TOKEN`.
3. On boot it finds the files → no crawl. Every Sunday at the scheduled time it rebuilds them.
4. Keep it awake: UptimeRobot → *Add New Monitor* → type **HTTP(s)**, URL `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/heartbeat`,
   interval 5 minutes. (`/heartbeat` answers both GET and HEAD.) A sleeping free instance would miss the Sunday job.

Free-plan caveat: the filesystem is ephemeral. The Sunday rebuild is served until the instance restarts or redeploys, then it falls back
to the files in the repo, so commit fresh JSON every now and then (or use a paid plan with a persistent disk and set `DATA_DIR` to its mount path).

## Configuration

See `.env.example` — every setting is documented there. The important ones: `REFRESH_TZ`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `DATA_DIR`,
`CORS_ORIGINS`, and optionally `SCRAPER_API_KEY` / `FLARESOLVERR_URL` if anikototv.to blocks your server's IP.
